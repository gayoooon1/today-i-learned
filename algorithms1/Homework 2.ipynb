    "I think it is the same. It is the worst case same as above. The reason why is that partitioning routine produces one subproblem with n-1 elements and one with 0 elements. According to the textbook, if unbalanced partitioning arises in each recursive call, the partitioning costs $O(n)$ time. The recursive call on an array of size 0 just returns, $T(0) = O(1)$, and the recurrence for the running time is $T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(0) + O(n) = T(n - 1) + O(n)$. If we sum the costs incurred at each level of the recursion, we get $O(n^2)$.\n"

The recurrence for the running time is them $T(n) = 2T(\\frac{n}{2}) + O(n)$ (ignore 1). By case of the master theorem, this recurrence has the solution $T(n) = O(nlogn)$."
