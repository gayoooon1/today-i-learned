    "According to the merge sort analysis, the proposition is that merge sort uses at most $6NlogN$ array accesses to sort any array of size N. The reason why is that array accesses are required to read 4 times and write 2 times. Based on the merge function above, the details are as it follows. To copy every array elements in auxilary space, array need to read and write during the for loop (Read 1 time, Write 1 time). After that, to merge each sub array, elements in the each left and right array compared. In this process, arrays need to be read (Read 2 times). If each arrays meet the condition, access is required to read each left or right array and write the value to the array in the input. (Read 1 time, Write 1 time) Each level needs 6N times of accesses and the total height of divided array is $logN$. In conclusion, total array accesses would be $6N*logN$."
