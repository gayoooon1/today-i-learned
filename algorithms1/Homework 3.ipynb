    "On the previous BFS and DFS that which input was the tree, I simply implemented the tree using dictionary, shape of {node(parent):[child]}. On the other hand, for the general graph as an input, I will use the dictionary to transform and keep the data as I did before, but in the shape of {node A :[a node which node A is heading(edge)]}. If I know the input graph, I will directly add the nodes and edges by myself. If I don't and input graphs are random, I would like to make a class named 'Graph' which is dictionary of list(using defaultdict(list) from collections library) and append the nodes and edges. With transformed input data, I will put these as a input on BFS and DFS.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For implementing BFS, I will use the data structure called queue because it is FIFO and fits on BFS. While queue is empty, every node in graph will be enqueued and marked as visited. While dequeue the node, enqueue the adjacent nodes and mark as visited. On the other hand, for implementing DFS, the stack is needed as a data structure because it is LIFO and fits on DFS. While stack is being empty, every node in graph will be pushed and marked as visited. While it pops, push the adjacent nodes and mark as visited. These implementation has a difference from (1,2) which is the time complexity. Previous tree BFS and DFS only needed O(Node) because they visit every node exactly once. However, BFS and DFS on general graph takes O(Vertices + Edges) of time complexity."
